						<div class="text-box">
							<p>I am an experienced Overwatch coach with a demonstrated history of working with teams in the T3 and T2 scene. I pride myself in my ability to teach concepts primarily via various visual mediums, whether that be VOD reviews, info graphics or web documents. For students with differing learning styles, I am able to accomodate them through hands-on drills and open discussions.
							</p>

							<p>I love to learn and teach, I learn more by teaching. I spend hours scouring over vods and researching new strategies. All with the purpose of demonstrating what I absorb back to my students. My ultimate goal is to help players with their fundamental understanding of the game so they can make better decisions in-game, as a team or as an individual.</p>

							<p>My personal understanding of the game stems from a more abstract point of view. I try to approach theory from outside the box. I would consider myself a jack of all trades. I am confident in my macro, micro, communications, mental, tactical and strategic coaching equally. </p>

								    </li>
									<li>
										Gained a lot of high level competitive overwatch experience scrimming in the T2 scene. The team even got some scrims vs Overwatch league teams which was a reality check of our skill.
									</li>
									<li>
										Unfortunately I had to leave for a planned vacation during contenders B-sides, so I had to shift all of my work to scouting as an attempt to prep for the matches ahead of time. I created documents with map specific positional setups for our team and for the opponents. I was not able to coach during the matches except for the first two. This process taught me a lot about how different T2 and T3 coaching is. The time crunch is a lot more difficult to deal with in T2 as the time between roster lock and the season is very short and players team hop often.
